```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Why

## How

### Asynchronous

#### Code ~~review~~ feedback

### Synchronous

#### Pair programming
Get a better sense of what coding standard the programmer should use

## A few more thoughts

### More is not always better
- Adding People when late can be counterproductive (Brooks’ law)
- Overtime is not the solution

### Project management
Agile: put it out there fast and iterate 

### Tools

- Version control system: say goodbye to “save as”
- Code repository: where we share code and communicate ideas and feedback
- Unit testing: checks that the code is still doing what it is supposed to do
