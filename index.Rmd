## Course description

The generation and analysis of environmental data is often a complex, multi-step process that may involve the collaboration of many people. Increasingly tools that document help to organize and document workflows are being used to ensure reproducibility and transparency of the results. This course will introduce students to conceptual organization of workflows as a way to conduct reproducible analyses, as well as various software tools that help users to manage multi-step processes that requires tools for storing, managing and sharing workflows, code, documents and data.

## Predictable daily schedule

**Course dates:** Monday (2021-08-02) - Friday (2021-08-06)

EDS 212 is an intensive 1-week long 2-unit course. Students should plan to attend all scheduled sessions. All course requirements will be completed between 8am and 5pm PST (M - F), i.e. you are not expected to do additional work for EDS 212 outside of those hours, unless you are working with the Teaching Assistant in student hours.

Tentative daily schedule (subject to change):

## Learning objectives

The goal of EDS 214 (Analytical Workflows and Scientific Reproducibility) is to expose incoming MEDS students to "good enough" practices of scientific programmingto develop skills in environmental data science to produce reproducible research. By the end of the course, students should be able to: 

-   **Develop knowledge in scientific analytical workflows** To learn how to make your data-riven research reproducible, it is important to develop scientific workflows that will be relying on programming to accomplish the necessary tasks to go from the raw data to the results  of your analysis (figures, new data, publications, ...). Scripting languages, even better open ones such as `R` and `python`, are well-suited for scientists to develop reproducible scientific workflows, but are not the only tools you will need to develop reproducible and collaborative workflows

-   **Learn how to code in a collaborative manner** for how all topics in EDS 212 are useful and used in applied environmental data science

-   **Being comfortable asking for and conducting code review** using `git` and `GitHub` to create pull request, ask for feedback from peers, and merge changes into the main repository

-   **Work with peers** to solve group tasks, then **communicate** the process of problem solving to the rest of the class


## Course requirements

### Computing

- Minimum MEDS device requirements (bring to all sessions)

- Have a ready to be used GitHub Account (https://github.com/) 


### Textbook

-   Required textbook / information

### Other requirements

-   Anything else
-   Important for students to know
